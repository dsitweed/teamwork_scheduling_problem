Certainly! Below is an example of how to use Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to solve a scheduling problem using Python and the `PuLP` library. This example assumes you want to schedule a set of parking requests with given start and end times to available parking slots.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the `PuLP` library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pulp
```

### Example Code

Here's a simple MILP example for scheduling parking requests:

```python
import pulp

# Define the data
requests = [
    {'id': 1, 'start': 1, 'end': 4},
    {'id': 2, 'start': 2, 'end': 5},
    {'id': 3, 'start': 3, 'end': 6},
    {'id': 4, 'start': 5, 'end': 7}
]
num_slots = 2  # Number of available parking slots

# Create a problem instance
prob = pulp.LpProblem("Parking_Scheduling", pulp.LpMaximize)

# Define the decision variables
# x[i][j] = 1 if request i is assigned to slot j, otherwise 0
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x",
    ((req['id'], slot) for req in requests for slot in range(num_slots)),
    cat='Binary')

# Define the objective function (Maximize number of scheduled requests)
prob += pulp.lpSum(x[req['id'], slot] for req in requests for slot in range(num_slots))

# Add constraints

# Each request can be assigned to only one slot
for req in requests:
    prob += pulp.lpSum(x[req['id'], slot] for slot in range(num_slots)) == 1

# No overlapping requests in the same slot
for slot in range(num_slots):
    for i in range(len(requests)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(requests)):
            req_i = requests[i]
            req_j = requests[j]
            prob += (x[req_i['id'], slot] + x[req_j['id'], slot] <= 1) if req_i['end'] > req_j['start'] else pulp.LpConstraint(equality=True)

# Solve the problem
prob.solve()

# Print the results
for req in requests:
    for slot in range(num_slots):
        if pulp.value(x[req['id'], slot]) == 1:
            print(f"Request {req['id']} is assigned to slot {slot} from {req['start']} to {req['end']}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Data Definition:**

   - The `requests` list contains parking requests with start and end times.
   - `num_slots` defines the number of available parking slots.

2. **Problem Instance:**

   - `prob` is the MILP problem to maximize the number of scheduled requests.

3. **Decision Variables:**

   - `x[i][j]` is a binary variable that indicates if request `i` is assigned to slot `j`.

4. **Objective Function:**

   - Maximize the total number of requests scheduled.

5. **Constraints:**

   - Each request can be assigned to only one slot.
   - No overlapping requests in the same slot.

6. **Solving and Output:**
   - The solver finds the optimal solution, and the results are printed.

This is a basic example and can be adjusted or extended based on more complex constraints or additional requirements for your specific parking scheduling problem.
